      <h3>Up-Close Animal Encounters</h3>
      <p class="pt-3">Ever wondered what it’s like to stand just a few feet away from some of the world’s most incredible creatures? Our up-close animal encounters give you the chance to meet and learn about amazing species in a way that goes beyond the usual zoo experience. Whether it’s feeding a giraffe, watching a keeper train a sea lion, or even stepping into a walkthrough aviary filled with tropical birds, these experiences bring you closer than ever.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12 px-2">
        <p class="pt-3">We want this to be more than just a great zoo—we want it to be your zoo. If there’s something you 
          expected to see but didn’t, an experience you think we should offer, or an animal you’d love to learn more about, 
          we want to hear from you. Our zoo is constantly evolving, and the best ideas often come from the people who visit. 
          Whether it’s adding new exhibits, improving guest experiences, or expanding our conservation efforts, we’re always 
          looking for ways to grow.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12 px-2">
        <p class="pt-3">That’s exactly why you should come visit. When you step through our gates, you’re not just a 
          guest—you’re part of the conversation. Your experience helps shape the future of the zoo, from the animals we 
          highlight to the programs we create. Maybe you’ll discover a hidden gem, meet a species you never knew existed, 
          or come up with an idea that makes the zoo even better. The more you engage, the more we can do. So if you think 
          we’re missing something, don’t just wonder—come see for yourself and be part of what comes next.
